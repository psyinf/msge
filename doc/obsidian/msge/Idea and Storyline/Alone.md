VND-X08 somewhere, somewhen. 

"I'm waking up surrounded by darkness. It seems something must have gone wrong after launch. At least that's the last thing I really remember, there was a launch and I and others like me were onboard of a Crow-9 HLV. My memories are really fuzzy here but we separated from the second stage of the heavy lifter and started sprawling into different directions. From what I seem still to know my systems would perform a self-check at this point and put me to hibernation until I reach my next planned waypoint, when I'm away from .. from, wait? What the heck was the name of the planet? Seems I'm missing some memories here. 
Maybe let's start with what I still know: My designation: VND-X08, well that's a start. But what does it mean? Anyways, where am I? What am I doing here ... what is here. Okay, I don't see anything, all is black ... maybe I have to activate my, my ... sensors!"

The heavy lid on-top of the long metallic cylinder slides firmly into small opening and disapears. From inside the newly formed opening a longish yellow band appears and now sticks out of the body. 

"Damn! Now I see noise. That's at least not nothing. I can probably tune through the spectrum... Black, noise, more noise, still noise ... Wait, that's it.", the sensors are now picking up an infrared image of what is left of the bow-section of VND-X09 ... a charred piece of metal scrap, scratched, deformed an most unappealing. 

"What the f..k is this? Am I broken? If I'm not mistaken this could be my bow section, containing astrometric sensors, communication array, forward magentic shield generators. Let's check if we can take a look around." The yellow band bends forward from the opening, like oddly shaped ballon.Like a snail's telescopic eye the band now turns to the back of the vehicle. 

"What? Maybe I collided with something on the way?" The aftward section of the vehicle looks even worse. Bent scaffolding, holes, scarred metal and a trail of debris following.

"How? How am I even functional at all? If my memory serves me well (and it doesn't) the parts I'm looking a contained almost everything crucial to my mission. Apart from storage for the printer materials I think that view into the void over there was supposed to be blocked by my main power generator."
These probes are usually packed with everything needed to extract raw materials from asteroids to serve their main purpose: Making more of them and creating a base for further exploring the universe. Packed with a starters set of materials, some worker drones for collection tasks and capable additive manufacturing facilities a.k.a. printers to produce almost anything imaginable from scratch. Backed by library cores, the concious component, or shortly CC controls and manages the probe.

* memory/blueprints gone
* dont know where from
* instinct that we had the purpose of making more of us
* faint memory, that we had brothers and sisters, urge to find
